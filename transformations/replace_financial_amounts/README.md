# Replace Financial amounts ü¶é  + ‚å®Ô∏è ‚Üí üêç
This transformation replaces consistently financial amounts throughout a text.
The replacement changes the amount, the writting format as well as the currency of the financial amount.
The change is consistent in regard to:
- the modifier used to change all amounts of the same currency throughout the text.
  - e.g., the sentence `I owe Fred ‚Ç¨ 20 and I need ‚Ç¨ 10 for the bus.` might be changed to `I owe Fred 2 906.37 Yen and I need 1 453.19 Yen for the bus.`
- the modifier used to change the amounts so that new amounts are relatively close to the original amount.
- the rate used for a change of currency, reflecting the actual bank rate.

## What type of a transformation is this?
This transformation acts like a perturbation to test robustness. Generated transformations display high similarity to the 
source sentences i.e. the code outputs highly precise generations. It is a substitution of a financial amount to another financial amount. 

## What tasks does it intend to benefit?
This perturbation would benefit all tasks which have a sentence/paragraph/document as input like text classification, 
text generation, etc. 

## Previous Work
1) This perturbation was as part of an augmentation library described by Regina and al. in (Arxiv 2020):
```bibtex
@article{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2007-02033,
  author    = {Mehdi Regina and
               Maxime Meyer and
               S{\'{e}}bastien Goutal},
  title     = {Text Data Augmentation: Towards better detection of spear-phishing
               emails},
  journal   = {CoRR},
  volume    = {abs/2007.02033},
  year      = {2020},
  url       = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02033},
  archivePrefix = {arXiv},
  eprint    = {2007.02033},
  timestamp = {Fri, 17 Jul 2020 15:39:46 +0200},
  biburl    = {https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2007-02033.bib},
  bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org}
}
```

## Common currencies
Not all currencies have conversion rate associated. For the moment, only six currencies have a conversion rate associated so that the currency can be changed to one another while keeping the converted amount close to the original amount value.
Those six currencies are: US dollar, Euro, Pound, Yen, Yuan and the Bitcoin.

Amounts corresponding to other currencies (e.g.: XAF) have just their amount modified.

## What are the limitations of this transformation?
The transformation's outputs are too simple to be used for data augmentation as a standalone module.
However, combined with other modules, this transformation helps improve the understanding of the context, and generates simple but precise similar sentences (same semantic similarity).

The transformation outputs financial amounts independently of the format expected for the country.
I.e. we might have `12,38 $` or `12.38 $` output by the generator.

The transformation can only change numeric financial amounts (i.e. it will not handle "two dollars" or "14k euros").

Finally, the transformation is case sensitive i.e. 13 usd will not be considered as an amount. 

## Testing

You can test that everything works well by launching the test using the command below.
Make sure that you are in `transformation/replace_financial_amounts` and do:
```bash
$ pytest -v
```
